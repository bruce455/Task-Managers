4/17/2025
Issues with code to fix:
- adding task on home redirects to calendar (likely because of calendar refresh)
- same day tasks don't always appear on home
- find way to make daily tasks show as complete (ideally without changing db but might be impossible)
- fix add task button
Past tasks - change databse to have flag for completion
table of completed tasks (instead of completion tag)
    - task id, user id, date completed
    - when loading daily tasks on home remove the completed ones that appear here
